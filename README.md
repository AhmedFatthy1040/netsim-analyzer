# NetSim Analyzer

A Python-based network simulation tool for analyzing BGP, OSPF, and other routing protocols. This project demonstrates practical implementation of network protocols and routing algorithms.

## Features

- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) simulation
  - Route advertisement and propagation
  - AS path-based route selection
  - Loop prevention
- OSPF implementation (coming soon)
- Network topology analysis
- Protocol behavior visualization

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Example coming soon.

## Development

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt
